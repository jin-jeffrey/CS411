As a logged-in user, I want to get recommendation of ebooks based on my music preference. When I log in my Spotify, it will access to my favorite songs
or songs that I usually listened. Based on my playlist, if I prefer some hiphop or rap music, through compared the music types and search the corresponding
ebooks, I probably would like to read some Action or Adventure which will be more fast-paced; or some Science Fiction or Humor that are light fiction rather 
than serious novels. If the app is not accurate, as a fan of rap, I may receive the recommendation of History or Art, which have quite high possibilities that
I would not like to read.

As a logged-in user, I want to get the right novels that fit in my mood right now. When I log in my Spotify, it will access to my favorite songs or songs that 
I am listening right now. So based on my songs, which may be about breaking up like “Someone like you”, the app will get the song’s type and song’s lyrics to 
search corresponding ebooks about “love”.For example, when I feel heartbroken or depressed at night because of a romantic relationship broke up, I want to read 
some Romantic or Fairy tale that I probably will have  the exact same experience or feelings, which may be my emotional outlet. But if things go wrong, and I 
get other genres books like Sci fiction or Horror fiction, it will definitely not help me.
